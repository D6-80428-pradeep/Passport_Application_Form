                <h2>Welcome to the official website of the PSP division of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government
                    of India!</h2>
                <p>This portal has been designed to provide comprehensive, reliable, user-friendly and one-stop source
                    of information on obtaining a passport by a citizen in India. If you are visiting this website for
                    the first time and are intending to apply for a passport or related service, you may spend a few
                    minutes in reading this advisory.</p>
                <h4>Requirement of a Passport:</h4>
                <p>All Indian citizens who depart or intend to depart from India are required to be in possession of a
                    valid passport or travel document. Under the Passports Act 1967, the Government of India may issue
                    different types of passports and travel documents such as Ordinary Passport, Diplomatic Passport,
                    Official Passport, Emergency Certificate and Certificate of Identity for the purpose.</p>
                <h4>Passport Application: Basic Requirements:</h4>
                <p>The prescribed passport application duly filled in should be with all prescribed documents and fees.
                    Merely submission of an application, however, does not constitute a claim for issue of a passport.
                    It remains a request/requisition for a passport, which may be rejected due to deficiency in the
                    supporting documents, not following the prescribed procedures or any other reason. The basic
                    supporting documents required with passport application include:

                    Proof of Date of Birth i.e. Birth Certificate, etc
                    Identity proof with photograph (to be verified by Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) Officials from the
                    address proof and other documents)
                    Proof of residence
                    Proof of nationality (to be verified by Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) Officials from the supporting
                    documents submitted).</p>
                <h4>Passport Issuing Authorities:</h4>
                <p>The Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India provides passport services through the Central
                    Passport Organisation (CPO) and its network of Passport Offices, Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and
                    Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK); and consular, passport and visa services to overseas
                    Indians/foreign nationals through the Indian Missions and Posts abroad. Indian passports are issued
                    through a network of 36 Passport Offices, CPV Division (only for Diplomatic and Official passports)
                    and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Administration. This network has been expanded by addition of 93
                    Passport Seva Kendras and 412 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras as extended arms of the Passport
                    Offices. For Indians living abroad, passport and other miscellaneous services are rendered by the
                    190 Indian Missions and Posts abroad.

                    An applicant may confirm the jurisdiction of the Passport Office, the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) and
                    the Post Office Passport Seva Kendra before submitting an application.
                    An applicant can also apply for passport from anywhere in India. Applicants can choose the Passport
                    Office (PO) and thus the desired Passport Seva Kendra (PSK)/ Post Office Passport Seva Kendra
                    (POPSK) under the PO where they wish to submit their application irrespective of whether the present
                    residential address specified in the application form lies within the jurisdiction of the selected
                    PO or not. The Police Verification would be conducted at the address specified in the application
                    form. The passport will be printed and dispatched by the PO selected for application submission by
                    the applicant.</p>
                <h4>Procedures:</h4>
                <p>Under Passport Seva, new measures and procedures have been introduced in order to improve governance
                    in Passport Offices. The new measures and procedures are aimed at ensuring citizens' comfort,
                    improvement in delivery of passport services, transparency and enhanced security. Applicants are now

                    biometrics and granting decision in their presence.</p>
                <h4>Online Registration and Appointment:</h4>
                <p> The Online Appointment system has been introduced to ensure avoiding congestion at the Passport Seva
                    Kendras (PSKs) and Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) and cutting down the waiting time for
                    applicants. Appointments are allotted according to handling capacity of a Passport Seva Kendra (PSK)
